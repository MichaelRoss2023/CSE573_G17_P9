# CSE573_G17_P9
Repository for the demo of Fraud Detection using Graph Databases and Machine Learning in CSE573 for ASU

The CODE sub-directory holds the code of the different traditional and state of the art methods used in our project.

The DATA sub-directory has the Amazon dataset that we used for the project in a zipped folder that when unzipped holds the .mat formated file. The dataset is zipped using 7zip in order to reduce its size enough to upload to GitHub, see https://www.7-zip.org/ for this tool.

The EVALUATION sub-directory holds the screenshots of results we achieved after running the different codes on the dataset.
